**CAPSTONE PROJECT**
**VOICEUP**:-*"VoiceUp: Amplify Your Voice for Change"*


My capstone idea, "VoiceUp: Amplify Your Voice for Change," revolves around the voice of an individual and collective voice as an instrument of bringing change in society. It emphasizes that each voice is a singular instrument with the potential to make a deep impact. The overall premise is to give the masses the ability to use their voices for social and individual change, with the belief that an individual voice has the ability to create waves of impact, and collectively, voices have the ability to change society and create change. Throughout the history of mankind, revolutions have been sparked by people who elected to speak up, highlighting the historical significance of speaking up. Capstone concept puts your voice in a position to act as a transformatory power. VoiceUp, as a technology solution product, is trying to transform communication efficiency and increase collaboration and productivity in today's workplaces.

VoiceUp is seeking to address the growing digital advocacy industry by having innovative products to offer direct messaging with policymakers so that one may effectively advocate. Although existing platforms like Change.org, Avaaz, iPetitions, and MoveOn.org are robust, they also possess some limitations such as not being directly in touch with the government, lacking gamification features, no coordination of volunteers, or being US-focused. VoiceUp is different from the others by offering real-time measurement of impact, engagement through gamification, coordination of communities, and making online advocacy an interactive movement. Some of the notable features and initiatives of VoiceUp include volunteer and event management to organize protests, rallies, and advocacy events, cause suggestions powered by AI for optimization of user engagement, and openness through data-informed impact measurement of real legislative effects created through petitions. It is mobile-first with a bugs-free device experience, built using React Native/Flutter.
VoiceUp is a doer website that exhorts activist user action to do more than signing petitions and demands active user participation and real interaction.

It is also intended to track quantifiable change and foster direct communications with policy makers. Technologically, VoiceUp employs the latest solutions for easy growth, including cloud-based infrastructure on AWS/Google Cloud for auto-scaling, secure and scalable database on MongoDB/Firebase, modular microservices for enhanced performance, AI-powered personalization, multilingual and global growth, and enhanced web and mobile experience. Additionally, VoiceUp is pushing forward with some of its most important initiatives on technology and partnerships, such as working with NGOs and government in scaling reach and impact, incorporating blockchain technology into secure and traceable petition streams, and creating APIs for third-party integrations for utility enhancement. The idea of the capstone then enables the idea of inner strength as a means of empowering people and the assertion that collaborative action has the power to bring about great change and profound alteration.
